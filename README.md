# ARP Spoofer 🛠️

## Description
ARP Spoofer is a simple Python tool that allows you to perform ARP spoofing on a local network. This tool sends forged ARP replies to trick a target device into thinking that your machine is the router, allowing you to intercept network traffic. 🚀

## Features
- Send ARP spoofing packets to a target IP. 📡
- Restore the original ARP mappings to the network. 🔄
- Simple command-line interface for user input. 💻

## Requirements
- Python 3.x 🐍
- `scapy` library 📦
- `pyfiglet` library 🎨


## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Alanbiju255/alan-arp-spoofer.git
   cd alan-arp-spoofer
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy pyfiglet
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
    sudo python3 arp.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to enter the target IP (the device you want to intercept) and the spoof IP (usually the router's IP). 🖥️➡️🖥️

3. To stop the spoofing, press `CTRL+C`. The script will automatically restore the network settings. ✋
